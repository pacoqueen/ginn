class FIM(Barcode):
    """"
    FIM (Facing ID Marks) encode only one letter.
    There are currently four defined:

    A   Courtesy reply mail with pre-printed POSTNET
    B   Business reply mail without pre-printed POSTNET
    C   Business reply mail with pre-printed POSTNET
    D   OCR Readable mail without pre-printed POSTNET

    Interleaved 2 of 5 is a numeric-only barcode.  It encodes an even
    number of digits; if an odd number is given, a 0 is prepended.

    Options that may be passed to constructor:

        value (single character string from the set A - D. required.):
            The value to encode.
   
        quiet (bool, default 1):
            Wether to include quiet zones in the symbol.
            
    The following may also be passed, but doing so will generate nonstandard
    symbols which should not be used. This is mainly documented here to
    show the defaults:
    
        height (float, default 5/8 inch):
            Height of the code. This might legitimately be overriden to make
            a taller symbol that will 'bleed' off the edge of the paper,
            leaving 5/8 inch remaining.
            
        lquiet (float, default 1/4 inch):
            Quiet zone size to left of code, if quiet is true.
            Default is the greater of .25 inch, or .15 times the symbol's
            length.
            
        rquiet (float, default 15/32 inch):
            Quiet zone size to right left of code, if quiet is true.

    POSTNET is used in the US to encode "zip codes" (postal codes) on
    mail. It can encode 5, 9, or 11 digit codes. I've read that it's
    pointless to do 5 digits, since USPS will just have to re-print
    them with 9 or 11 digits.
