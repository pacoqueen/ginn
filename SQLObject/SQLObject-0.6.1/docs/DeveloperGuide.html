<h1><a name="style-guide">Style Guide</a></h1>
<p>Generally you should follow the recommendations in <a class="reference" href="http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0008.html">PEP 8</a>, the
Python Style Guide.  Some things to take particular note of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>No tabs</strong>.  Not anywhere.  Always indent with 4 spaces.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">I don't stress too much on line length.  But try to break lines up
by grouping with parenthesis instead of with backslashes (if you
can).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">But if you are having problems with line length, maybe you should
just break the expression up into multiple statements.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Blank lines between methods, unless they are very small and closely
bound to each other.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Never use the form <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">condition</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">trueValue</span> <span class="pre">or</span> <span class="pre">falseValue</span></tt>.  Break
it out and use a variable.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Careful of namespace pollution.  SQLObject does allow for <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">from</span>
<span class="pre">sqlobject</span> <span class="pre">import</span> <span class="pre">*</span></tt> so names should be fairly distinct, or they
shouldn't be exported in <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">sqlobject.__init__</span></tt>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">I'm very picky about whitespace.  There's one and only one right way
to do it.  Good examples:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
short = 3
longerVar = 4

if x == 4:
    do stuff

func(arg1='a', arg2='b')
func((a + b)*10)
</pre>
<p><strong>Bad</strong> examples:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
short    =3
longerVar=4

if x==4: do stuff

func(arg1 = 'a', arg2 = 'b')
func(a,b)
func( a, b )
[ 1, 2, 3 ]
</pre>
<p>To me, the poor use of whitespace seems lazy.  I'll think less of
your code (justified or not) for this very trivial reason.  I will
fix all your code for you if you don't do it yourself, because I
can't bear to look at sloppy whitespace.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Use <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">&#64;&#64;</span></tt> to mark something that is suboptimal, or where you have a
concern that it's not right.  Try to also date it and put your
username there.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Docstrings are good.  They should look like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
class AClass(object):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    doc string...
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
</pre>
<p>Don't use single quotes (''').  Don't bother trying make the string
less vertically compact.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Comments go right before the thing they are commenting on.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Methods never, ever, ever start with capital letters.  Generally
only classes are capitalized.  But definitely never methods.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">mixedCase is preferred.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Use <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">cls</span></tt> to refer to a class.  Use <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">meta</span></tt> to refer to a
metaclass (which also happens to be a class, but calling a metaclass
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">cls</span></tt> will be confusing).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Use <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">isinstance</span></tt> instead of comparing types.  E.g.:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
if isinstance(var, str): ...
# Bad:
if type(var) is StringType: ...
</pre>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Never, ever use two leading underscores.  This is annoyingly
private.  If name clashes are a concern, use name mangling instead
(e.g., <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">_SO_blahblah</span></tt>).  This is essentially the same thing as
double-underscore, only it's transparent where double underscore
obscures.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Module names should be unique in the package.  Subpackages shouldn't
share module names with sibling or parent packages.  Sadly this
isn't possible for <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">__init__</span></tt>, but it's otherwise easy enough.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Module names should be all lower case, and probably have no
underscores (smushedwords).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="testing">
<h1><a name="testing">Testing</a></h1>
<p>Tests are important.  Tests keep everything from falling apart.  All
new additions should have tests.</p>
<p>Right now all the tests are in one big file <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">tests.py</span></tt>.  Which is
unfortunate, but that's the way it is.  They may seem complex, but
they aren't so bad really.  They all subclass from <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">SQLObjectTest</span></tt>.</p>
<p>The <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">classes</span></tt> attribute is special in a test class.  This is a list
of <cite>SQLObject</cite> subclasses that this test uses.  <cite>SQLObjectTest</cite> will
create the tables before the tests are run, and destroy them after.</p>
<p>You may also define an <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">.inserts()</span></tt> method.  This method sets up the
basic data.  When doing verbose input (<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">-vv</span></tt>) you won't see these
inserts, since they may be overwhelming.  Use the command-line options
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">--inserts</span></tt> to show them (as well as the create statement.</p>
<p>When running tests, use <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">-ddbname</span></tt> to test with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">dbname</span></tt> (e.g.,
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">-dmysql</span></tt>, <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">-dpostgres</span></tt>, etc), or <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">-dall</span></tt> to use Postgres,
MySQL, Firebird, and SQLite (all the core supported databases;
everything I have installed on my computer).  Please try to test as
many databases as you can.  At least SQLite and one other should be
easy, though if you can test both Postgres and MySQL that would be
much better.</p>
<p>If you submit a patch or implement a feature without a test, I'll be
forced to write the test.  That's no fun for me, to just be writing
tests.  So please, write tests; everything at least needs to be
exercised, even if the tests are absolutely complete.</p>
